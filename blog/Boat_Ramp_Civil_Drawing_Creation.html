      <p>
    In these videos, I'm walking through the process of creating a set of civil drawings using
    AutoCAD and Carlson Civil Suite 2024 for a boat ramp project located on the Green River in Kentucky.
    I start by showcasing the project folder on my desktop and an overview of the completed plan set.

<h2>Cover Sheet and Location Map Creation</h2>

<div class="iframe-container">

    </iframe>
</div>

<p>
    I describe the contents of the plan set, including location details and how to generate site layouts
    from survey data. I'll demonstrate how to create existing condition elevations and proposed contour
    elevations for the ramp using Carlson Civil Suite 2024 tools. In the first video I explain how to set up the first drawing,
    which includes the cover sheet and location map.
</p>

<p>
    Next, I discuss a way of opening AutoCAD in safe mode to avoid loading unnecessary extensions
    when I'm working with basic drawings. I then open my template for the cover sheet, organize my project files,
    and use resources from the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet to obtain a location image for the project.</p>

<p>
    After exporting the image, I demonstrate how to insert it into my AutoCAD drawing, adjust its scale, and properly
    manage the drawing order. I also plan to add my organization's logo and make additional adjustments to the layout.
    Finally, I prepare to save my work and proceed to develop the site layout.

<h2>Surface File Creation</h2>

<div class="iframe-container">
    <iframe class="responsive-iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/25xpDx0PPrU">
    </iframe>
</div>

<p>
    In this video section I'm going to create existing condition contours for the boat ramp
    area. My primary goal was to integrate both lidar data and survey points to develop a
    comprehensive surface elevation model that accurately reflects the terrain.
</p>

<p>
    I started by importing a text file containing our surveyed location points, which included information
    such as point numbers, elevations, and descriptions. After setting up my project with Carlson Civil Suite 2024,
    I imported these points and proceeded to acquire lidar data from Kentucky's digital elevation model repository.
    With the lidar data downloaded and extracted, I also gathered aerial images to enhance the context of the project area.
    Creating a rectangle around the area of interest allowed me to focus solely on the relevant lidar data.
</p>

<p>
    Using some Carlson utilities, I generated contours from the lidar data. I also created a TIN
    (Triangulated Irregular Network) file to facilitate easier manipulation of the data, which helped streamline 
    the workflow. I triangulated my survey points and drew break lines to define the edges of the slope and the ramp.
    I was able to place the break lines accurately by using my drone aerial image, ensuring they aligned with the
    surveyed data. Finally, I merged the lidar and survey data together to create a surface model that serves as a solid
    foundation for existing conditions.
</p>

<h2>Layout Page Creation</h2>

<div class="iframe-container">
    <iframe class="responsive-iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3MvLnFzgt8M">
    </iframe>
</div>

<p>
    In the beginning, I outline the process of creating a layout page using survey data and contour lines.
    I start by pulling in my existing contour data from a finalized survey point file. After selecting
    the contours, I adjust their appearance, particularly the line types and scales, to ensure they are
    displayed correctly in the paper space layout. A typical conventions is dashed
    lines represent existing contours, while solid lines indicate proposed contours.
</p>

<p>
    Next, I focus on designing a boat ramp, determining the tie-in elevation, which I set at elevation 410. I create a
    3D polyline to represent the ramp's centerline, ensuring it aligns with existing contours. Using specific 
    grade percentages of 17%, I calculate the ramp's slope and finalize its design elevation, which I want to be 
    390 so that when the water is at the design elevation of 393.5 there is 3.5 feet of water to launch a boat.
    Carlson's software tools facilitate this design process, allowing me to edit elevation points easily and
    visualize the ramp's alignment.
</p>

<p>
    After establishing the ramp's geometry, I work on defining its width and shoulders. I set up alignment lines for
    the ramp's edges and offsets to accommodate 5-foot shoulders on each side. By adjusting the UCS (User Coordinate
    System) back to the world reference, I ensure that my design maintains consistency. This involves checking and
    setting the correct elevations for all line segments involved in the ramp's design, ensuring accuracy before 
    moving forward.
</p>

<p>
    Following the completion of the ramp layout, I turn my attention to generating proposed contours based on the
    ramp's design. Utilizing Carlson's grading tools, I establish the pad template and calculate necessary volumes 
    for cuts and fills. I integrate this new ramp data with existing conditions to create a final surface that
    reflects all changes.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, I create and adjust the final contours of the ramp, ensuring they are distinguishable from existing
    contours. I enhance visual clarity by applying transparency to the aerial image and adding important annotations
    like a north arrow and a bar scale to the layout.
</p>

<h2>Alignment, Profile and Cross Section Creation</h2>

<div class="iframe-container">
    <iframe class="responsive-iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hT9hWtcfnEY">
    </iframe>
</div>

<p>
    In this video, I walk through the process of plotting a ramp, focusing specifically on a ramp centerline, profile, and cross sections.
    I begin by demonstrate how to establish a centerline. I create a new file for the centerline, selecting the appropriate polyline to represent it.
    I set the stationing intervals, ensuring the centerline is clearly defined and labeled.
</p>

<p>
    Next, I proceed to draw the centerline within the design file, using a specific color standard for visibility. Once I have the centerline in place,
    I use it to create profiles for both existing and proposed ramp conditions. I emphasize the importance of extending the centerline slightly beyond the
    ramp endpoints for clarity in the final output. After verifying the profiles for accuracy, I make adjustments to ensure they align with my 
    display preferences.
</p>

<p>
    I then move on to plotting the ramp profiles. I set up the plotting parameters, ensuring the scales are appropriate for the layout. I opt for dashed
    lines and color coding to differentiate between existing and proposed conditions. Once I'm satisfied with how the profiles look on the page, I start 
    creating cross-sections along the ramp.
</p>

<p>
    For the cross-sections, I initiate the process by selecting a starting and ending point along the centerline. I define the surface models for
    both existing and proposed conditions, naming the output files accordingly. I choose to create cross-sections every 10 feet, ensuring a
    comprehensive representation of the ramp's profile. After calculating the cross-sections, I plot them and review how they appear alongside the
    ramp profiles, checking the alignment and coloring.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, I focus on organizing the cross-sections into a clear layout for presentation. I group the sections into sets of four,
    making adjustments to ensure they fit well on the page. I lock layers to avoid accidentally adjusting a plotted scale.
    Arranging the cross-sections ensures that the final output is readable and ready for the plans.
</p>

<h2>Project Structure Overview</h2>

<div class="iframe-container">
    <iframe class="responsive-iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IJ5UivQJ8YM">
    </iframe>
</div>

<p>
    In this transcript, I share my approach to organizing project folders for a boat ramp project. I
    start by explaining that at the root of my project folder, I keep the final plans along with
    the cost estimate. I've created several subfolders for different types of materials, including
    CAD files, drone pictures, and survey information.
</p>

<p>
    I emphasize the importance of having separate files for different aspects of the project. For example,
    I create distinct CAD models for each section of the plan, such as layout, details, and existing conditions.
    This way, I can manage what gets displayed without having to deal with multiple layers across various pages.
    By chunking the information into smaller models, I streamline the plotting process and minimize the need to
    turn off layers individually.
</p>

<p>
    I also discuss my setup for the details page, where I draw elements to scale. I make a copy of my
    page in one-to-one model space, allowing me to create different viewports at varying scales. This
    setup ensures that dimensions and details remain accurate and give the flexibility of having multiple
    scales on the same page.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, I summarize how I group related files, such as existing and proposed conditions, to keep
    my project organized. This structured approach helps me effectively manage the creation of the ramp
    plan set and ensures I can easy find and modify files in the future if needed.
